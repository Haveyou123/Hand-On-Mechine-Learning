# CHAPTER 1
# The Machine Learning Landscape

Machine Learning has been around for a long time in 1957, stemming from Frank Rosenlatt's idea with the first machine learning algorithm called Perceptron Learning capable of classifying two different concepts

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science. It uses data and input algorithms to autonomously solve problems and continuously optimize to generate new, more effective solutions, similar to the way the human brain learns.

The primary goals of applying machine learning are statistical analysis and prediction, which is why these systems are designed with the ability to self-study and improve based on initial programming principles. In many cases, machine learning can propose optimal solutions without being explicitly pre-programmed to do so.

You could think of machine learning as a "worker" capable of self-learning, self-improvement, and gaining experience over time. But how exactly does machine learning operate, and what mechanisms lie behind its remarkable capabilities?

1. The "self-learning" process of Machine Learning
